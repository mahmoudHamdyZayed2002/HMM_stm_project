# Custom Memory Management System

This project implements a custom memory management system in C, providing functions similar to `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. Additionally, it includes utility functions for managing memory blocks and displaying the free list.

## Introduction

The memory management system implemented in this project offers dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using custom functions. It provides functionalities such as memory allocation (`my_malloc`), memory deallocation (`my_free`), zero-initialized memory allocation (`my_calloc`), and memory reallocation (`my_realloc`). Furthermore, it includes utility functions for initializing the memory management system, finding free memory blocks, merging adjacent free blocks, splitting blocks, and displaying the free list.

## Getting Started

To use the memory management system in your C project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <github.com/mahmoudHamdyZayed2002/HMM_stm_project/edit/main/README.md>
